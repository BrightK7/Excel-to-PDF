Your style is exactly what I was looking for, and it definitely stands out as it's more rare to find Chinese tattoo artists in Edmonton. It really helps that you speak Chinese, because my mom speaks Cantonese and Mandarin really well, but not so much English, and I think it would be a really cool experience if our first tattoos were done by you (I still can't believe that my Asian mom is getting a tattoo with me haha).
